The **GitHub Issues Blog** is a React.js and TypeScript-based project developed as part of the [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) ReactJS formation. This application leverages ViteJS to provide a fast and efficient development environment. The primary goal of this project is to create a dynamic blog interface by utilizing the GitHub API to fetch and display issues from a repository.

## Features

-   **Profile Display**: Showcase your GitHub profile with all the essentials—profile picture, follower count, name, and more—directly pulled from the GitHub API.
-   **Issues Listing & Filtering**: Browse and filter through all issues from a specified repository, with each issue summarized for easy viewing.
-   **Detailed Issue View**: Dive deep into any issue with a dedicated page that presents the full content, just like reading a blog post
